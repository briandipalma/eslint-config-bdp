# eslint-config-bdp

Personal ESLint shareable configuration. How to use them is [documented on the ESLint]
(http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) website.

This contains two configurations, the default one which enables ES2015 and the React one which
extends the default one and adds React support.

To use the default configuration you need to install `eslint` and for the React one you also
need to install `eslint-plugin-react`.
