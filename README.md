[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/briandipalma/eslint-config-bdp/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/briandipalma/eslint-config-bdp#info=devDependencies)

Personal, scoped (`@briandipalma/eslint-config-bdp`), ESLint shareable configuration. How to use them is
[documented on the ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) website.

This contains three configurations, the default one which enables ES2015, the React one which
extends the default one and adds React support and the React + Flow one which extends the React one and adds Flow
support.

To use the default configuration you need to install `eslint`, for the React one you also
need to install `eslint-plugin-react`, for the Flow one you also need to install `babel-eslint`.
